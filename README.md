##Purpose

Do you remember how some books have multiple options, which may lead you to a whole different scenario?
If so, then you may know how this works! The purpose of this project is to create a story, consisting of multiple scenarios.
Every scenario has at least two different options or answers to choose from. This will change the overall outcome of the story.
